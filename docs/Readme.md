# Connected Canine User's Guide



The Connected Canine Platform provides access to a complete workflow for Companies and Pet Owners to register themselves, their respective pets, evaluate, approve, and reserve days to bring their pets into the office.

There are Three Active Roles - Company Administrator, Pet Owner, and Pet Evaluator. The Property Manager Role is currently a reporting role where reports are emailed on a monthly basis.
