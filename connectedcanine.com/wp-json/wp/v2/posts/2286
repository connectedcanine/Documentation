If your dog has teeth issues or problems chewing, powder or paste probiotics can be the best solution. A more natural source of probiotics is yogurt or kefir, however lactose can upset a dog\u2019s stomach. Make sure to get a variety with live cultures. Many brands of probiotics for dogs contain different strains. Some products use cultures made from yogurt and may not contain live probiotics. Check the label to make sure there are no artificial sweeteners.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fermented foods also contain live probiotic cultures. Raw goat milk, kombucha, vegetables, and tempeh are all excellent sources for humans and some can be for dogs too. Always consult your veterinarian before changing your dog\u2019s diet, especially in the case of probiotics or supplements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying dog probiotics for stomach irritation can seem easy &#8211; most brands come with instructions and a dosage calculator. Most dogs can tolerate the dosages with no adverse effects. Regardless of your dog&#8217;s age and weight, you should buy one that works well for your dog. Besides, you&#8217;ll be doing your dog a favor by providing them with some probiotics to help them fight against digestion issues.
